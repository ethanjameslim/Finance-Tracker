# Finance-Tracker
Personal Finance Tracker Website Project
I built this website as a final project for the CS50 Course by harvard and is my first ever personal project>
My idea was that I could use this website to aid my finnancial management When I start university overseas next year.
The functionality that I have added so far include.

1. Adding and Deleting expenses.
2. Managing budgets.
3. Visualising these budgets in a Spending vs Budget bar graph for each month.
4. Notification when a buget is exceeded for that month.
